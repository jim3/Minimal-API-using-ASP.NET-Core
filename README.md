## ASP.NET Core Minimal API

### Description

Experimenting with ASP.NET Core's using the Minimal API as opposed to the one that uses a controller (a bit of a learning curve on that version). Basic create, read, update, and delete app like the others. 

#### Installation (assuming you have .NET Core installed, this app uses `dotnet --version 7.0.105`)

1.  `git clone ${repo_url}` and `cd ${project_folder}`
2.  Run the command `dotnet run`.
4. The API should now be accessible at `http://localhost:5115/api/parts` in a web browser or via an API client like [Postman](https://www.postman.com)
5. The code resides in `Program.cs`
