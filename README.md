## C# / .NET Restful API for an Inventory Management System

### Description

The project is a Restful API for an Inventory Management System. It is a simple inventory management system that allows users to create, read, update, and delete items in inventory. It is written in C# and uses the .NET Core framework. Like the Flask (and Go) project, this project was created to see how different each of these frameworks were to work with. In the end, they are a fairly similar, at least on a basic level. Suprisingly, as much as I've grown to like JavaScript, I think I like C# the most. It's a very clean language, has proper classes and it's strongly typed, which I have a preference for. I am now curious how it handles asynchronous code. I think I'll be using C# more in the future.

### Installation (assuming you have .NET Core installed)

1. Clone the repository from GitHub using git clone.
2. Open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code or another code editor.
3. Open a terminal in the root directory of the project and run the command `dotnet run` to start the API.
4. The API should now be accessible at `http://localhost:5000/api/parts` in a web browser or via an API client like [Postman](https://www.postman.com)
5. The code resides in `Program.cs`
