## C# / .NET Restful API for an Inventory Management System

### Description

The project is a Restful API for an Inventory Management System. It is a simple inventory management system that allows users to create, read, update, and delete items in inventory. It is written in C# and uses the .NET Core framework. Like the Flask (and Go) project, this project was created to see how different each of the frameworks were to work with. In the end, they are a fairly similar, at least on a basic level. 

#### Installation (assuming you have .NET Core installed, this app uses `dotnet --version 7.0.105`)

1.  `git clone ${repo_url}` and `cd ${project_folder}`
2.  Run the command `dotnet run`.
4. The API should now be accessible at `http://localhost:5115/api/parts` in a web browser or via an API client like [Postman](https://www.postman.com)
5. The code resides in `Program.cs`
